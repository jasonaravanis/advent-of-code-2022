1) take input and separate by each line

each line can be one of the following types:

* COMMAND (starts with $)
* OUTPUT (starts with dir or a file size number)

Each command be one of the following types:

* CHANGE DIRECTORY
    * to home /
    * to subdirectory xyz
    * to parent directory ..
* LIST CURRENT DIRECTORY CONTENTS (ls)

2) create a data structure made of nodes, where each node has a single parent and can have multiple child nodes

use a Folder class
a Folder can have a parent folder (or it's null in the case of the root directory)
a Folder contains a list of items
an item can be a Folder or a File

a File has a size and a name

3) create a piece of state that remembers:
    * what directory path we are currently examining (currentDirectoryPath)
    * if we are in list mode


4) for an input line

if the line is "$ cd /"
    reset current directory path
if the line is "$ cd xyz"
    append "/xyz" to currentDirectoryPath
if the line is "$ cd .."
    remove the last part of the currentDirectoryPath
if the line is "$ ls"
    we enter list mode
if the line is "dir xyz"
    we create a new Folder with the name xyz and add it as a child of the folder at the currentDirectoryPath
if the line is "1234 abc.anything"
    we create a new File with the name abc and add it as a child of the folder at the currentDirectoryPath


5) After we have loaded all the data into the folder tree, we can then use a recursive function to go through all branches and get dir size

    * create an array to hold references to all Folders that have a size smaller than 100000 called SMALL_FOLDERS (potential to replace this with just an array of folder sizes)
    * call a function that takes a reference to the root Folder as an argument
    * within the function, get the size of the folder by first totalling any file sizes in the directory
    * then, if there are child folders call the function in a recursive way to get the size of each child folder
    * terminal case is we get the size of the folder based on the sum of the size of its children
        * if the total size of folder is less than 100000, add a reference to that Folder to the SMALL_FOLDERS array (or maybe just the folder size)
        * then return the size value so it can be used in parent folder calculation

    * get the sum of the folder sizes from the array
