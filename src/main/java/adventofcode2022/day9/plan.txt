we don't know the size of the grid

assume we start at  0, 0 and use normal x y axis

Rope object
has Head
has Tail

Head has coordinates
Tail has coordinates

we take in input and convert to list of instructions
for each instruction...
we process instruction
we record coordinates of head
we calculate new coordinates of tail
we move tail
we store coordinates of tail

 if newHead not adjacent to Tail, tail takes prevHead position

for each move we need to know
    * start position
    * direction (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, UP_LEFT, UP_RIGHT, DOWN_LEFT, DOWN_RIGHT)

We can use the concept of a Position object, with methods to return new Positions based on direction


Position object also has an isAdjacent method that evaluates if another position is next to or on top of current position
