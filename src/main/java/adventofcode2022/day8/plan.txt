We can use a two-dimensional array for this data

to load the input we separate each line by \n
for a line
    * we create an array
    * we separate each digit
    for each digit we insert it in the array at [i][j]

we then loop over i and j to go through every digit

*************************************************************

 for a digit, we don't care how it's visible, only that it is visible.

 wherever the number is, it's in a row and a column
 for the row, we split it into two pieces for the left and right of the number
 for the column, we split it into two pieces for the above and below of the number

 for a number in the grid to be visible:
 the max value in the left portion is less than the number
 OR
 the max value in the right portion is less than the number
 OR
 the max value in the top portion is less than the number
 OR
 the max value in the bottom portion is less than the number
 OR
 it's index value for i is 0 or max (it's on the edge of the grid)
 OR
 it's index value for j is 0 or max (it's on the edge of the grid)

 *************************************************************

 for i
    for j

    Array left = sub array from 0 to i
    Array right = sub array from i + 1 to end
    Array top = ...
        loop through rows 0 to j
        for each row get digit at i
    Array bottom = ...
        loop through rows j + 1 to end
        for each row get digit at i

    get max value from each array

    apply conditional logic to get visibility status
