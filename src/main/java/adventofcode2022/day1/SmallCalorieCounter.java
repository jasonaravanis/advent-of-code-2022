//        the small calorie counter doesn't need a reader
    // it can just use a string
    // so should I get the string in the main method? Or should I do it in small calorie counter?
    // SmallCalorieCounter will implement the same interface as LargeCalorieCounter, it will have the same static methods
    // meaning it should receive the string, or maybe a path to the file?
    // maybe LargeCalorieCounter should also just receive a path to the file?
    // and the logic for reading into a reader should be in it's own package.
